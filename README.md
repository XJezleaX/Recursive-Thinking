# Recursive-Thinking Project

The goal of this program is to implement four different recursive functions:

1) A function that produces an inputed number as a binary number. If given zero, then only one zero will be printed.
2) Produce a triangular pattern, utiliizing asterisks, for a certain amount of lines.
3) A function which may compute a pow function and have log(n) time.
4) Repeat a sentence a certain amount of times, indenting after each new line.
